# Python Web Monitor
A website monitor (or webpage monitor) is a program that repeatedly requests a webpage and notifies the user, via text or email, when it has detected any changes.

I published [this tutorial on Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/tutorial-creating-a-webpage-monitor-using-python-and-running-it-on-a-raspberry-pi-df763c142dac) that outlines how I made this webpage monitor script.
